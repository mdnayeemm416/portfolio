<h3>A baby web developer</h3>
<p>I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript;  And inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.</p>
